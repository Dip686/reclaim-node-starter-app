# Reclaim Node Starter App
The **Reclaim Node Starter App** is a comprehensive application that provides a quick start for developers interested in working with the Reclaim Protocol's Node APIs. It includes both server and client components, making it easy for developers to get started with building applications that leverage the power of Reclaim Node APIs.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the server and front-end components of the Reclaim Node Starter App:

### Running the Server

1. Navigate to the server folder using your terminal:
```bash
cd server
```

2. Run the server by executing the following command:
```bash
  node index.js
```

3. Replace the IP address in the configuration with your own system's IP address. If you prefer to use a different provider, you can configure it as well. This is all you need to run the server component.

### Running the Front-End

1. Navigate to the client folder:
```bash
cd client

```

2. Start the front-end application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

3. To connect to the server, you can use the Reclaim Wallet mobile app by scanning the provided QR code.
